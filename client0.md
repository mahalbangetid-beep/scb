I have just noticed something.

Are we not able to get the provider external ID here?
I mean, can we fetch the provider’s external ID in this system or not?

If this is not possible, then how will the provider send or reference the external ID from their side?

I am honestly shocked because I did not see the external ID mentioned anywhere.

Please let me know after properly checking this.

If this is not possible, then automation will not work at all, and it will create serious issues.

Please explain this clearly after verification.
