Please create a separate section where, if a keyword is matched, the system defines what reply should be sent.
This will make configuration and management much easier.

[14:30, 15/01/2026] +977 981-4818047: As I understand it, you have designed the system to charge $0.02 per message.
However, what I explained earlier was different.

My idea is as follows:

The user will purchase message credits in advance, for example:

$50 = 5,000 message credits

Every time a message is sent or received through the system, credits will be deducted from the user’s balance.

The message cost and credit rate should be fully customizable, and we should be able to set different rates for each user manually.

Free & Paid Setup Structure

For the first time, the following should be free:

WhatsApp login

SMM panel linking

Telegram linking

After that, the system should apply monthly charges for:

WhatsApp

Telegram

Linked SMM panels

Additional Connections

If a user wants to add extra WhatsApp numbers, Telegram accounts, or SMM panels, they must pay additional monthly charges for each extra connection.

Auto-Renewal System

Monthly charges should be auto-deducted from the user’s balance.

The system should support automatic monthly renewal.

If the user’s balance is insufficient, services can be paused or limited automatically.

Message Credit Pricing

There should be a message credit pricing list (plans/packages).

Charges should be calculated based on the selected message credit plan.
