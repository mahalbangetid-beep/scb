Try to add a user section with a direct login option, so the admin or master admin can log in directly to a user’s dashboard without needing the user’s login credentials.

This is useful because sometimes users face issues on their side. In such cases, the master admin should be able to access the user’s account directly, check the issue from the inside, and resolve it manually.
